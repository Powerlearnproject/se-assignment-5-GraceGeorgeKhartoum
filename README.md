                        Step Through Code:
                        
                        Step Over (F10): Executes the current line of code and moves to the next line.
                        Step Into (F11): Moves the debugger into a function call or method.
                        Step Out (Shift+F11): Executes the remaining lines of the current function and returns to the caller.
                        Inspect Variables:
                        
                        While debugging, hover over variables in your code to see their current values.
                        Use the Variables view in the Debug panel to inspect and modify variables.
                        Watch Expressions:
                        
                        Add expressions to the Watch view to monitor their values as you step through your code.
                        Call Stack:
                        
                        View the current call stack and navigate to different stack frames to understand the execution flow.
                        Debug Console:
                        
                        Use the Debug Console in VS Code to execute commands or evaluate expressions in the context of your running application.
                        Conditional Breakpoints:
                        
                        Set breakpoints that only trigger based on certain conditions (e.g., when a variable reaches a specific value).
                        Exception Handling:
                        
                        Configure VS Code to break execution when exceptions are thrown, allowing you to inspect the state of your application at the point of failure.
                        Multi-session Debugging:
                        
                        Debug multiple instances of your application simultaneously, useful for client-server scenarios or microservices.
                        Debugging Configuration:
                        
                        Customize and save different debugging configurations (launch.json) for different scenarios (e.g., development vs. production debugging).
